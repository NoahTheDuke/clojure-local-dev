# Clojure local dev

A repo to make Clojure's development process easier for me.

## Instructions

1. Create a new branch with `./new-branch.sh`.
2. Develop branch. Push branch to Clojure fork on GitHub and create a self-PR. Develop until the feature is done and the build passes.
3. In the branch's worktree directory, format a patch via `../format-patch.sh`.
